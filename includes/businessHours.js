// IñigoSync — Shared operating-hours constants (Part 3, multi-hour booking —
// implementation_plan.md, "Multi-hour booking with availability checking").
// Updated by Revision 5 (implementation_plan.md, D1/D2) — see below.
//
// Before this file existed, the sports center's operating hours were three
// separate, hardcoded, and mutually inconsistent hour lists:
//   - Pages/user_dashboard.html's Step 2 slot buttons: 8 AM-8 PM, and — a
//     real bug — SKIPPED 12:00 PM entirely (12 of 13 possible hours only).
//   - includes/Dashboard.js's OVERVIEW_SLOT_HOURS (the Overview "Peek
//     slots" widget): 8 AM-8 PM, correctly including noon.
//   - includes/staff_dashboard.js's SCHEDULE_SLOTS (the Court Schedule
//     grid): 2-hour columns from 8 AM, its LAST column covering only
//     6 PM-8 PM — silently unable to ever show a booking in the 8 PM-9 PM
//     hour, because it assumed closing time was 8 PM, not 9 PM.
// Every consumer now reads OPEN_HOUR/CLOSE_HOUR from here instead, so
// there is exactly one place that says what the sports center's bookable
// hours are. There is no operating-hours row in `app_settings`
// (database/schema/007_app_settings.sql) or anywhere else in the live
// database — like that file's payment defaults, this is a hardcoded
// fallback the whole app agrees on until an admin-configurable setting
// exists for it.
//
// Revision 5, D1 (implementation_plan.md) — CLOSE_HOUR moves from 21 (9 PM)
// to 20 (8 PM), on the user's explicit instruction that the sports center's
// bookable window is 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM (12 whole-hour slots: 8-9, 9-10, …
// 7-8 PM), not 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM. Every consumer that already reads
// OPEN_HOUR/CLOSE_HOUR from here (the customer dashboard's Overview peek
// widget and Step 2 time pickers, the staff Court Schedule) picks this up
// automatically with no code change of their own — see each file's own
// comments for what one fewer bookable hour means there.
//
// This project ships plain <script src> tags (no build step, no ES
// modules), so this attaches to window, same as includes/courtsData.js and
// includes/appSettings.js. Load this after Config/supabaseClient.js (not
// actually required by this file, but keeps this project's <script> block
// ordering easy to reason about) and BEFORE includes/Dashboard.js and
// includes/staff_dashboard.js, both of which read window.InigoBusinessHours
// at parse time (top-level `const` hour lists), not just inside a later
// callback.

    // briefly made it yield ONE MORE column (through hour 20) once
